# Blackjack

## Setup
1. Clone the project
2. cd into the directory
3. run `open index.html`

## If you are running the 5.2 starter session, after cloning, run this command:
1. `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/5.2-starter`

Since there aren't any external dependencies (for now...) there is no installation process. 

Tested on Node v 14.19.0->LTS.
